- messenger subscribes to actionmanager list of associated interactions (to mingle with other messengers)
- messenger sends whether action has occured (true/false) when another interaction sends message Start/Stop through Interact function
- when all associated actions have occured, actionmanager sends "Complete" message to base

KeyValue pairs:
- user assigns a unique id to each association on their messenger (messengers must link up with the same id for whatever event... ie.)
	messenger A uses IDs: 1, 2, 4, 7
	messenger B uses IDs: 1, 3, 7, 9

	Subset of Both: 1, 7

	therefore: actionmanager will store a key relationship between the two events associated with unique ids 1 and 7
- once all events under a unique id have been fullfilled (call interact("Trigger") on the specific gameobject),
	the action manager calls complete to the BASE of a messenger link... (the messenger will ignore this msg, but your specific object should,
	contain and an interactable component that filters a ("Complete") message


*warning: not much safety checking at this point*
*do not have more than one BASE for each association*
